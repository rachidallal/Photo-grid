# Photo-grid

A responsive Photo grid showcasing my loving and amazing friends. There might not be many pictures at the moment, but i tried to go for a quality over quantity mindset. I tried to have a minimalistic look to my design, and use reliable patterns like grids and centered elements, further I also included some grow hover effects to each image to let the user have interactivity, and it is a quick and fun way of getting closer to the images. 

I used the w3schools stylesheet to do the animations, all the image links are approved pictures from a good friend of mine, taken from Facebook. 
I will keep on adding pictures to my phot grid as time goes on.
Kind regards 
Rachid.
